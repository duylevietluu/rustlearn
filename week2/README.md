# CS241 Week 2

This repository contains my Rust programming solutions for Week 2.

## Programs

### Frequency Analysis Program

The "freq" program calculates the frequency of characters in a given text and prints out a summary of character distribution.

To compile and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin freq
cargo run --bin freq < inputfile
```

### Counting Change Program

The "coins" program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations.

To compile and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin coins
cargo run --bin coins < inputfile
```

## Usage

- For each program, navigate to the `src` directory and open the corresponding `.rs` file to view and modify the source code.
- To compile and run a program, use the `cargo run` command along with the appropriate `--bin` flag and optional redirection for input.
