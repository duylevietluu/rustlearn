# rustlearn

Notes about my journey in learning Rust by building small programs during the System Programming course I took last year.

## Introduction

In this repository, I've documented my experiences, challenges, and progress as I learned Rust through practical coding exercises and projects. The programs I've built during the course are stored in the `rustlearn` directory.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning process and provide insights into how Rust was introduced and practiced in the context of system programming. The notes, code snippets, and programs are meant to serve as a resource for myself and others interested in learning Rust.

## Goals

My main goals while learning Rust were to understand its unique features, memory management, and concurrency mechanisms. I aimed to gain proficiency in Rust's syntax and idiomatic patterns to write safe and efficient code for systems programming tasks.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or want to discuss Rust and system programming further.
