# CS241 Week 1

This repository contains my Rust programming of week 1.

## Programs

### "Hello, World!" Program

The "Hello, World!" program prints a personalized message with various formatted numbers.

To compile and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin hello
```

### rot128 Encryption Program

The `rot128` program encrypts files using a custom encryption algorithm.

To compile and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin rot128 < inputfile > outputfile
```

### Diamond Program

The `diamond` program generates an diamond based on user input.

To compile and run:

```sh
cargo run --bin diamond
```

## Usage

- For each program, navigate to the `src` directory and open the corresponding `rs` file to view and modify the source code.
- To compile and run a program, use the `cargo run` command along with the appropriate `--bin` flag and optional redirection for input and output.
